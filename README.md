# Lioncub

Lioncub is an extension for Easy Digital Downloads which creates dynamic IonCube licenses on-the-fly during download. Each EDD download can have unique license settings, which include a passphrase, headers, properties, restrictions and expiry. Customer name and email shortcodes {NAME} and {EMAIL} can be used in headers and properties for personalization of licenses.
